So, with the help of the online wedsite the NGO will adopt the dogs and also give the to one who wants to adopt the dog. so we developed a online which will be helpful for NGO's and customers who are willing to adopt the pets ...

## problem Description

The problem with online pet adoption is the lack of a centralized and reliable platform that effectively connects potential pet owners with adoptable animals. Existing websites or platforms may have limited listings, outdated information, or lack user-friendly features, resulting in a frustrating and inefficient experience for both adopters and animal shelters/rescue organizations. This fragmentation and lack of standardization make it difficult for adopters to find the right pet for their preferences, lifestyle, and location, leading to longer adoption processes and potentially discouraging potential adopters from using these platforms altogether. Furthermore, the absence of comprehensive profiles and detailed information about the animals can make it challenging for adopters to make informed decisions. These issues ultimately hinder the successful and timely adoption of pets, increasing the risk of animals remaining in shelters or being euthanized due to overcrowding.
